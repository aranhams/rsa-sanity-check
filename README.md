# RSA Sanity Check


Script for extracting data from SSL digital certificates such as module, public expo, signature algorithm, issuer country, issuer name, hash algorithm, domains and if is self signed.

Please, if you will use this script for any academic project, include this reference in your paper:
**_Soon_**

If you have contributions and improvements make me a pull request.

Comments:
You need to install some libraries for the correct operation of the script:

- asn1crypto.x509
- gmpy2
